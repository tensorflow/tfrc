Researchers require enormous computational resources to train the machine
learning models that have delivered recent breakthroughs in
[medical imaging](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/03/assisting-pathologists-in-detecting.html),
[neural machine translation](https://research.googleblog.com/2016/09/a-neural-network-for-machine.html),
[game playing](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/), and many other domains.
We believe that significantly larger amounts of computation will make it
possible for researchers to invent new types of ML models that will be even more
accurate and useful.

To accelerate the pace of open machine-learning research, we have introduced the
**TensorFlow Research Cloud** (TFRC), a cluster of 1,000
[Cloud TPUs](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/) that are made available free of
charge to support a broad range of computationally-intensive research projects
that might not be possible otherwise.
